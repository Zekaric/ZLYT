# ZLYT - Zekaric: Log Your Thoughts

Web log software at a much simpler level than, say, WordPress.  I was using WordPress on my site 
until some hacker or the my hoster messed it up and I couldn't recover the site as it was last.  I 
am not someone who wants to spend too much time on site administration.  And I always wanted more 
control over my site than what WorkPress or any other software provided.

Yes I will be losing a lot of potential features going this route but I think I will be happier in 
the end.
